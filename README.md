# Bible-Crawler-Rust

My very first Program written in Rust.
So this is a simple Web-Crawler.
It fetches .html from a Bible-Website and converts it to .md files.
Until now I provide some german Versions and in the Future international Versions.

If you want a special Version, than please open an Issue.

Just try it.
Download the Binary in the release Section. You'll find an Exectuable for Windows and for Linux.

God bless you!

## Mac & Linux release
run in Terminal following command before running the binary:
```
sudo chmod +x ./bible-crawler
```
