# Bible-Crawler-Rust

So this is a simple Web-Crawler.
It fetches .html from a Bible-Website (die-bibel.de & bibleserver.com) and converts it to .md files and .md files for each chapter for [Bible Linker Plugin](https://github.com/kuchejak/obsidian-bible-linker-plugin).
Until now I provide some german Versions and BTX.

If you want a special Version, than please open an Issue.

Just try it.
Download the Binary in the release Section. You'll find an Exectuable for Windows, Mac and for Linux.

God bless you!

## Mac & Linux release
run in Terminal following command before running the binary:
```
sudo chmod +x ./bible-crawler
```
