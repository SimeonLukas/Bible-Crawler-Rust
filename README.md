# Bible-Crawler-Rust

My very first Program written in Rust.
So this is a simple Web-Crawler.
It fetches .html from a Bible-Website and converts it to .md files.
Until now I provide the new Einheits√ºbersetzung and the new Luther-Version.
But its Easy to add other versions.

Please try it.
Just download the Binary in the release Section. You'll find an Exectuable for Windows and for Linux.

God bless you!
